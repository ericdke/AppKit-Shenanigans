# AppKit Shenanigans

AppKit is awesome, but AppKit is old and grumpy.

Sometimes the best solution with AppKit is not obvious, and sometimes it's downright obscure.

I've compiled some of my findings.

If you see something preposterous or plain wrong, please make a pull request with a better solution, I'll appreciate it. Thanks.
